I am a phd student in [MediaBrainGroup](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/) [SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and a intern in Shanghai AI lab. I received a master degree also from SJTU, [INPAC](https://inpac.sjtu.edu.cn/) and a bachelor degree from [BIT](https://bit.edu.cn/).
My current research interest is in fast MRI reconstruction.
